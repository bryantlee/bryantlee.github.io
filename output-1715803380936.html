                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: &gt;&gt; Hey Joe. I work for a workforce management organization. I work for a workforce management.</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: Hey, Brian. Thanks for the time today. Hey, just wanted to introduce myself again. So Joe over at</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: dispatch and I&#x27;ll get into a little bit about what we do. But one of the things I would love to just</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: check in with you is first time we&#x27;re meeting, tell me a little bit about your company and maybe</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: what you&#x27;re looking to get out of this call.</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: A workforce management company called S, the two S&#x27;s. We have a ton of products. We&#x27;ve acquired a couple companies.</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: Awesome. Well, we&#x27;re going to talk about just that. Before we get started, we&#x27;re going to talk about</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: We actually are about to rename ourselves to Alvaria. And yeah, I lead our sales team.</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: I also run the sales off functions. A little crazy. So yeah, we&#x27;re just trying to see how dispatch can help us.</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: just that. Before we get into it, do you still have 30 minutes? Just want to check the time and make sure.</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: Perfect. So we work with a lot of companies just like yours. You mentioned workforce management.</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: Yeah, 30 minutes.</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: We see this all the time. And when we work with these companies, we know that renewals and expansion</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: revenue, it&#x27;s not the biggest focus. It&#x27;s really acquiring new customers. That is the goal. And</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: &gt;&gt; Thank you.</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: every quarter, it probably feels like a race to meet those targets. Because one, new customers are</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: [ Silence ]</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: the most important thing. And you as a sales leader, you can&#x27;t be everywhere at once. So one of the</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: things that we&#x27;re seeing on our end is multiplying yourself to turn those opportunities into real</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: sales opportunities would be the most impactful use of your time. Are you feeling any of that</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: right now? How our first meeting is going for you and your sales process? I&#x27;m going way off.</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: Okay.</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: &gt;&gt; I have no idea. Honestly, we have such a big team, lots of people. I don&#x27;t know how first meetings are going. Is that something that other -- how do you know that this is a problem?</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: One, that&#x27;s very normal. I think half the time, a sales funnel or a sales stage is going to look</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: [ Silence ]</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: something like this, where you have these deals coming in as you&#x27;re seeing on the graph, and they&#x27;re</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: moving forward. And some of them maybe you&#x27;ve been involved in some of them you haven&#x27;t, and you</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: really don&#x27;t know why things aren&#x27;t progressing. You don&#x27;t know why things didn&#x27;t go past an early</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: conversation. It sounds like that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re saying. Is that right? That yes,</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: conversations are going forward. But some of them you have no idea if they went good or bad.</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: &gt;&gt; Yeah, I guess like having done that type of inspection on our sales funnel data, but I&#x27;d imagine looking at this is probably the case.</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: The yeah, the question there is, if those first meetings could have gone better, if you could</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: [ Silence ]</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: have been in more, do you think that they would have changed? Often we see this combination of</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: things died early, where they could have gone better earlier on, you would have known more</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: about that customer would have had a better middle later stage conversation. But instead,</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: they died. And then you find yourself trying to get things over the line with what little you</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: have left. Yeah. Okay, so what we see typically with sales managers, by the way, I am this talk</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: &gt;&gt; I think all my sales managers are supposed to join the calls. So that should be the goal for the team. We have about a five to one ratio right now.</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: [ Silence ]</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: truck is bad, I gotta change it. But we see with sales managers is that when you look at the course</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: of their day, they&#x27;re on a bunch of things at once, right? They have to wake up each morning</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: and decide, do I join a first meeting? Do I join a late stage sync on a deal that needs to get over</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: the line? Do I push a price pricing call forward? And then they have those one on ones. And all of</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: this noise combines with the fact that they&#x27;re not spending their time on these first conversations.</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: [ Silence ]</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: In fact, they&#x27;re just finding out too late, often in a QBR, or some sort of event that happens later</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: in the quarter, and they missed the opportunity to have an impact. You mentioned those sales</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: managers today, how are they joining? Like, how are they doing this right now? Are they joining</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: first meetings? Are they using Gong or anything like that? Yeah. That&#x27;s what we hear. So we ask</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: &gt;&gt; Yeah, I think right now we just have them join meetings. If you were to ask me, do they join them with what frequency? I have no idea.</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: I think the goal would be, yeah, they join -- that they can join every meeting.</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: people to join every meeting, you know that you&#x27;re going to get the direct knowledge of that. The</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: problem is, it&#x27;s not scalable. And it&#x27;s probably impractical for them to keep up with that you</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: mentioned a five to one ratio. So as they grow their team, it&#x27;s going to get more confusing.</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: Are you guys recording calls today? Is that something you&#x27;re looking into?</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: [ Silence ]</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: Where&#x27;s your head at in terms of addressing this?</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: Hmm. We also hear that it turns into just a another task to either find them schedule time</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: &gt;&gt; Pretty spotty. They have to hit record. I definitely don&#x27;t think we have consistency. I actually don&#x27;t even know where to find them.</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: [ Silence ]</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: in your day. Those are things we work with, I think, in a perfect world, your managers would</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: be on those every single call without being on every call. And I&#x27;m going to skate through this</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: probably because I am struggling at the moment. The goal here would be two things would be that</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: they know what conversations to put their time and energy into. And the ones they miss aren&#x27;t</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: things that they find out a year later, right or a quarter later, but they know that it could have</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: been influenced or already is going well, right after it happens. So we&#x27;re talking a lot about</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: dispatch, but I just want to see. Brian, I am sorry. Hold on one second. Okay. So I&#x27;m going to</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: talk a little bit about dispatch. It all comes down to getting immediate notifications of where</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: you need to put your energy and what you need to do to enable your team to make the most of every</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: early stage conversation. The whole goal here, Brian, especially at aspect is as you look into</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: transforming into Alvaria, you need to give those managers time back in their day so that they can</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: get away from negotiating their schedule, spending all the time figuring out where to join,</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: where to focus and summarize just to get into one-on-one meetings to hopefully make an impact</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: and transform that into they know exactly what to put their time and energy. And they use that</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: notification that they get from dispatch to immediately share feedback that makes a change,</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: which means this isn&#x27;t happening in QBRs. This is happening while the deals are still</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: influensible. I&#x27;d love to take you through a demo. What are you thinking so far? Is this even resonating</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: [ Silence ]</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: &gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, I&#x27;ll be honest. I don&#x27;t think I understand what my team is doing, my manager doing, their effectiveness. So I think anything to give me visibility would be helpful.</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: [ Silence ]</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: for you? I&#x27;m going to stop recording.</p>
