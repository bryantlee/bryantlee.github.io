                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: I&#x27;m ready.</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: Hey Joe, how are you today?</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: Hey, I&#x27;m good. How are you?</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: Ah, you know, alright.</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: Yeah, yeah, glad to be here.</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: I, um, a lot of calls going, I&#x27;m a little stressed out, but</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: it&#x27;s alright, we&#x27;ll get through it. Thanks for joining.</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: Hey, remind me, why did you take this call again?</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: So we&#x27;ve got a lot of new sellers</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: [silence]</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: and I just don&#x27;t have the time.</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: And at this point, I&#x27;m just looking to see</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: if there&#x27;s anything that might be able to help me</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: scale this team.</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: [BLANK_AUDIO]</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: Oh, that&#x27;s interesting.</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: Um, okay, well let&#x27;s jump into</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: dispatch. Sounds like you maybe need what we have.</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: Um, so yeah, dispatch is a</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: company and, you know, our founder, gosh,</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: you know, started to realize that early field interactions</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: are these essentially make or break moments. They&#x27;re super important,</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: easy to miss, but, you know, it&#x27;s kind of like</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: this important thing where if you do these well, like, we see</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: that you can close more. You&#x27;re just gonna, like, believe us, it&#x27;s pretty good, but um,</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: let me kind of describe what that means. So, you know, we see</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: [BLANK_AUDIO]</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: that early on, you know, marketing is doing everything they can</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: to get leads, right, to get stuff to people like you</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: [BLANK_AUDIO]</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: to go sell, and you&#x27;re doing everything you can to close</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: opportunities. And obviously we know this is not some beautiful one-to-one</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: relationship where every lead turns into a closing. It&#x27;s a small fraction, right?</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: And, you know, when you think about your time as a</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: sales leader, you&#x27;re probably thinking, hey, you want to focus</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: on mid to late stage opportunities, things that are more likely to close,</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: and that&#x27;s probably a good use of your time, right? Like, why wouldn&#x27;t you spend time there?</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: But do you really have time for these early conversations?</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: Like, when they&#x27;re hot, when you want to go and talk to them?</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: You know, I don&#x27;t know, like, I&#x27;ve heard sales people that don&#x27;t do anything with their day</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: or sales leaders that are just golfing. So, you know, how can you</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: extend your time and influence if you&#x27;re not on your computer, right?</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: Yeah, yeah.</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: I&#x27;m curious, like, are you a big golfer?</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: [BLANK_AUDIO]</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: I hate golf.</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: All right, cool.</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: [BLANK_AUDIO]</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: But so, you know, how about these other interactions?</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: So you helped out with a couple, your sales rep had good fit,</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: Yeah.</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: and these people moved forward, and really our product is about, hey, let&#x27;s</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: [BLANK_AUDIO]</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: go and extend your influence across your interactions. So,</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: Nice, yeah.</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: I wonder, like, today, how do you look at what happened in your early meetings?</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: [BLANK_AUDIO]</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: {silence}</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: Yeah, so we have gone.</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: I have a library of calls that I need to watch</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: and I joined when I can, right?</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: I joined the conversations where we&#x27;ve got some new people coming on,</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: anything that&#x27;s a big deal, I make sure that I am there.</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: But that&#x27;s probably the main two ways right now.</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: [BLANK_AUDIO]</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: Interesting. Any dashboards? You have, like, a sales office person?</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: Yeah, yeah, we&#x27;ve got dashboards.</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: {silence}</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: You know, I don&#x27;t even really think about them</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: when it comes to first meetings at this point.</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: I&#x27;m focused on conversion, but I&#x27;m really just trying to get this team</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: to perform right now before I even think about conversion.</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: Do you know what your conversion rate is? Like,</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: [BLANK_AUDIO]</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: these first meetings, like, how often are you getting more, like, legit</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: opportunities?</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: So we are seeing things go from that NQL to SAL about 30%.</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: {silence}</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: If we take a first meeting, I&#x27;d say there&#x27;s a 50% chance</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: they&#x27;re going to come back for a second meeting</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: and we&#x27;ll continue the qualification process right now.</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: [BLANK_AUDIO]</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: 50%, not bad. Not bad. I would say that&#x27;s pretty good.</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: You might not need a...</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: Yeah, we&#x27;re getting there.</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: [BLANK_AUDIO]</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: Perhaps you can use a different company, because this is really good.</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: [LAUGHTER]</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: So that makes sense. We see that a lot out there,</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: [BLANK_AUDIO]</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: and those are all very good ways to understand what has happened in your</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: business, but, like you said, those dashboards, they don&#x27;t really</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: give you a lot of information around the specific interactions of your customers.</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: [BLANK_AUDIO]</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: And, like, let&#x27;s be honest, joining line meetings, or listening to Gong</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: Chorus, that&#x27;s a slog. Tough to do. Takes a ton of time.</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: And, like we said earlier in that slide, you&#x27;re probably spending time</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: on the most important meetings, and not</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: these early ones, which is really where our focus is. And essentially, we&#x27;re trying to have you</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: be on every call without being on every call. We want you to extend your</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: capability, multiply yourself, and your impact across the organization.</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: So that&#x27;s all about... That&#x27;s all what dispatch does. And essentially, we</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: produce this immediate notification to any meetings that need your attention.</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: So you can choose where you put your time and energy, and your team can make the most</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: out of every interaction. And initially, this might be knowing what&#x27;s happening on the ground,</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: and then over time, it&#x27;s just being aware of these anomalies that</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: really impact your business. So</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: if we take dispatch and put it into place, you start</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: [BLANK_AUDIO]</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: at this place where you&#x27;re constantly trying to decide where to spend your time,</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: negotiate between your schedule and the priority meetings. You have to</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: make this decision. Like, what call do I join? Do I sit in this meeting and take</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: notes? Am I multitasking? Are you trying to actually get a structured</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: output from this meeting to know what went good and what bad, what went well, or what</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: [BLANK_AUDIO]</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: didn&#x27;t? And then you gotta follow up with your</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: direct reports. There&#x27;s just so much going on.</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: [BLANK_AUDIO]</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: And our goal is for you to be less retrospective and more</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: impactful. The moment a meeting happens that you&#x27;re not on,</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: because it&#x27;s an early meeting, it&#x27;s one that you&#x27;re not so sure is worth spending the time on,</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: you&#x27;ll get a notification. You&#x27;ll immediately understand what happened in</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: that meeting and get some suggested actions. Maybe you need to intervene.</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: Maybe it wasn&#x27;t a big deal. And we just make it really easy for you to share that feedback</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: [BLANK_AUDIO]</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: with your team. And we think that if we remove</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: all of this noise, your calendar goes from</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: [BLANK_AUDIO]</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: this essentially impossible</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: transaction where you can&#x27;t be everywhere at once to now where you&#x27;re</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: spending time meeting with your team, spending time on</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: strategy, thinking about how to improve the business as opposed to</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: constantly just being on meetings because you feel like you have to.</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: [BLANK_AUDIO]</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: Yeah.</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: So, Joe, I&#x27;m curious, do you have this problem? Do you</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: [BLANK_AUDIO]</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: feel the pull of your schedule and trying to be everywhere at the same time?</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: Oh, you can go.</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: Even on this call right now, I&#x27;m getting destroyed on Slack, right?</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: People are asking questions.</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: Yeah.</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: [LAUGHTER]</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: Understood. Understood. Well, let me go through a quick demo here.</p>
                <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: [BLANK_AUDIO]</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: Actually, I asked you earlier if we could record</p>
                <p><strong>Company</strong>: this call.</p>
