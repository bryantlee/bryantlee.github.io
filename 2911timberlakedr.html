    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals with Subtle Accents -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A top-down, dashboard-driven SPA. The user starts with a high-level summary (key findings, total costs) and can then navigate to detailed sections (Roof, Electrical, etc.) via a persistent sidebar. This structure facilitates quick understanding of the overall situation while allowing deep dives into specific areas of concern. It's designed for decision-making, moving from 'What's the bottom line?' to 'Let's see the details.' Key interactions include toggling cost views on the chart (low vs. high estimates) and expanding detailed explanations for each issue. This avoids overwhelming the user with the 300+ page report, presenting a curated, prioritized view first. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: The core visualization is a dynamic bar chart for repair costs. Goal: Compare financial impact. Viz: Horizontal Bar Chart (Chart.js/Canvas). Interaction: Users can toggle between 'Average Cost' and 'High-End Estimate' datasets, instantly seeing the financial risk profile change. This is more impactful than a static table. For organizing information, a card-based layout is used for inspection items. Goal: Organize details logically. Presentation: HTML/CSS cards with clear headers, icons, and expandable sections. Interaction: Clicking a card reveals detailed text (Why it's a problem, negotiation leverage). Justification: This progressive disclosure keeps the initial view clean while making deep-dive information accessible on demand, supporting the designed dashboard-to-details flow. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

                            <p>Your primary negotiation tool is the <strong>Inspection Contingency</strong> in your contract, which allows you to cancel or renegotiate. Given the severity of these findings, you are in a strong position.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Focus on Credits/Price Reduction:</strong> Do not ask the seller to perform repairs. You need to control the quality and scope of this critical work. Request a credit at closing or a direct reduction of the purchase price.</li>
                                <li><strong>Use Professional Quotes:</strong> Back up your request with written estimates from licensed contractors for the roof, electrical, and mold remediation. This transforms your request from an opinion into a data-driven fact.</li>
                                <li><strong>Highlight Insurability:</strong> Emphasize that no lender will finance the property without insurance, and no insurer will cover it with the current roof and electrical panel. The property is effectively unmarketable to any other financed buyer until these issues are fixed.</li>

                        <p>This property represents an extreme level of risk and financial commitment. The most prudent path is to <strong>walk away</strong> unless an aggressive renegotiation achieves a purchase price at or below the <strong>$283,000 maximum prudent offer</strong>. Proceeding at a higher price means you are inheriting the seller's liabilities and will almost certainly be over-invested in the property from day one.</p>
