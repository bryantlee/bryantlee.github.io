                <p><strong>Google Chrome</strong>: Yeah, just about. Yeah, awesome. Thank you.</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: Recording. Hey, Bryant, thanks for having me today. Just want to make sure you still have 30 minutes.</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: Cool. Okay, well, as mentioned, I&#x27;m Joe Shufo. I work with Dispatch, and we&#x27;re going to go through</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: a little bit of what we deliver today as a company. We&#x27;ll talk about some of the ways that</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: we help folks, and we&#x27;ll get started from there. Why don&#x27;t we do an introduction? Can you tell me</p>
                <p><strong>Google Chrome</strong>: Yeah, I just started a job at an AI startup and I don&#x27;t know a lot about the space. I got two sales reps that work for me and I&#x27;m just really not sure what they&#x27;re doing.</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: a little bit about yourself? That&#x27;s super helpful. You said something about what your reps are doing</p>
                <p><strong>Google Chrome</strong>: I&#x27;m spending a lot of time kind of building the business and it&#x27;d be helpful to understand what my reps are doing out in the field and really getting a feeling for what&#x27;s working and what&#x27;s not.</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: out in the field. You&#x27;re building the business, and this comes back to where we focus. We&#x27;ve got</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: this opinion that early sales interactions are pretty much a make-or-break moment, and I get</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: the sense that you&#x27;re probably feeling the pull of all the places you need to be. When we work with</p>
                <p><strong>Google Chrome</strong>: Yeah.</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: folks, we typically see that marketing is going to do everything they can to create more leads,</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: and you over in sales are doing everything you can to close more opportunities, but as a sales leader,</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: you&#x27;re probably focused on these mid to late stage opportunities, and no one can fault you.</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: That&#x27;s the best use of your time. Is that right? Is that where you&#x27;re feeling a lot of the pull</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: right now towards these later conversations? Yeah.</p>
                <p><strong>Google Chrome</strong>: Yeah, you know, there&#x27;s a handful that I get pulled in by our CEO and that&#x27;s probably where I find my time.</p>
                <p><strong>Google Chrome</strong>: The other thing is the, you know, I am trying to spend more time. It&#x27;s a new business. We don&#x27;t have a lot of material yet, so I also find myself in the strategy world to just trying to build out our go to market strategy.</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: I get it. I think this is what we see when we talk to leaders like you. One,</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: how do you find the time to join early conversations? The ones you do join,</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: probably in the fringes of your day, or in your case, because the material isn&#x27;t ready yet,</p>
                <p><strong>Google Chrome</strong>: Yeah.</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: you find yourself having to hop on just out of necessity. You don&#x27;t get that time back to build</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: the material that would have helped other people scale on those. When we talk to sales leaders,</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: we see that they probably could have spent more time helping those first meetings, but the time</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: isn&#x27;t there. At the end of the day, you&#x27;re just trying to extend your guidance and your influence</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: while you can actually protect your calendar. Let me ask you a question, though. What are you</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: doing today to join those first meetings outside of just when your CEO bugs you and brings you into</p>
                <p><strong>Google Chrome</strong>: Yeah, it&#x27;s basically that I either join and I do get kind of a readout from my one on ones with my reps. But other than that, it&#x27;s either I&#x27;m joining or I&#x27;m getting this kind of updates over Slack or over a live call.</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: them? That&#x27;s helpful. Yeah, we hear a lot that those updates are coming in. Either you&#x27;re trying</p>
                <p><strong>Google Chrome</strong>: We use Google Meet, so we record the meeting there and occasionally I&#x27;ll peruse a meeting.</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: to figure out where to put your attention in a dashboard, you&#x27;re joining live meetings like</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: you mentioned, or are you guys using gong or chorus or anything like that today to review</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: things that you aren&#x27;t joining live? Okay. Pass them around. That&#x27;s a great call out.</p>
                <p><strong>Google Chrome</strong>: But really, we haven&#x27;t really decided to use course or going there.</p>
                <p><strong>Google Chrome</strong>: You know, it&#x27;s a fair point. Any reason why, like how you guys are different from them?</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: So one course and gong are both really good at what they do. You&#x27;re going to get all the details</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: you need about the opportunities. But at the end of the day, when we talk to folks, course and gong</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: are still homework, it&#x27;s still time consuming to review. You&#x27;ve got to find times in your nights</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: or weekends to actually go through those meetings. And hopefully it&#x27;s not on two x where you actually</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: get none of that. I&#x27;m sure you probably felt that in some Google Meet recordings too. So that that&#x27;s</p>
                <p><strong>Google Chrome</strong>: Yeah, I mean, they&#x27;re there. I don&#x27;t enjoy it.</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: the hope, right? Is that at the end of the day, you have these dashboards that lack detailed</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: visibility. You&#x27;re joining live meetings, there&#x27;s no way you can scale that and you don&#x27;t want more</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: homework through gong and chorus. In a perfect world, you could be on every call without being</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: on every call. And it comes back to what you said earlier, we want to scale your influence and</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: understand the reason behind those metrics that you&#x27;re seeing in dashboards. One of the things,</p>
                <p><strong>Google Chrome</strong>: Yeah, you know, I think knowing how to help my reps is important.</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: and I&#x27;m just riffing now because I&#x27;m distracted. One of the things that we talk about with most</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: folks is that they want to get away from guessing. They want to be clear and precise in terms of how</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: they&#x27;re coaching reps. Is that what you&#x27;re what you talked about earlier? Is that something you&#x27;re</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: looking for? Yeah.</p>
                <p><strong>Google Chrome</strong>: Honestly, I think if I had to consider where I spend my most time, it&#x27;s all around driving new deals, right?</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: So when we talk about how dispatch helps, the crux of it all is you need to know where to put</p>
                <p><strong>Google Chrome</strong>: I&#x27;m curious how you feel about that, right? Like how this product can actually drive more opportunities, more revenue to the business. I&#x27;m sure helping reps is important, but like what is actually practically happening to our pipeline when we implement dispatch?</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: your time and attention. And so when you think about driving pipeline and closing new opportunities,</p>
                <p><strong>Google Chrome</strong>: Yeah.</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: it&#x27;s about making the most of every single one. You mentioned earlier, you can&#x27;t be on every call,</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: you&#x27;re trying to create resources to have better early discussions. You&#x27;re being pulled in with</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: your CEO. That&#x27;s a lot going on. With us, we can give you notifications the moment a conversation</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: needs your attention so that you can either guide it and give it the right direction it needs to go,</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: or learn what went wrong and coach your reps or build the materials they need to right those</p>
                <p><strong>Google Chrome</strong>: Yeah, with the two reps, I feel like I&#x27;m okay at keeping up. I can imagine this becoming a bit overwhelming as we scale the team.</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: wrongs next time. Does that sound like something that you&#x27;re even looking for? How are you feeling</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: about this so far? Yeah.</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: Yeah. That is, you bring up maybe one of the main points you see here. When you look at the</p>
                <p><strong>Google Chrome</strong>: And, you know, we&#x27;ve already got a few head kind of out there. So, you know, from my perspective, if I can really go and understand what they&#x27;re doing and making sure that they&#x27;re using or selling the way we want them to, and that&#x27;s barely a process today, but we&#x27;re building over time, I think that&#x27;d be really interesting.</p>
                <p><strong>Google Chrome</strong>: Okay.</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: way things are done today, you&#x27;re probably having to negotiate what&#x27;s going on in your day, which</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: call you&#x27;re going to join, who&#x27;s bringing you in, how do you give them the right guidance and then</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: schedule the time to review. And there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that, especially right now with two</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: reps. This is something you can maybe keep within the bounds of your normal, we&#x27;ll say eight to five</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: knowing that you get pulled into a lot. But over time as you scale, that&#x27;s going to be really tough.</p>
                <p><strong>Google Chrome</strong>: Thank you.</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: So what we look to do is focus on that notification that gives you the things you need to share</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: feedback to guide your reps, which means you&#x27;re getting away from a world where you&#x27;re fighting</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: with your calendar every moment and you&#x27;re distracted and you&#x27;re moving to a place where</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: you get to choose where you put your time and you get to choose where you put your energy. And we&#x27;re</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: going to help you along the way so that you can actually have some conversations to step into with</p>
                <p><strong>Google Chrome</strong>: Well, I mean, I certainly can appreciate knowing and being more than one place at once to use your language. But how do I know it&#x27;s helpful?</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: your reps with the right information. Anything that scares you off so far, anything that&#x27;s</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: making you go, this is not it for me. Yeah. So let&#x27;s take a look at the demo. Actually,</p>
                <p><strong>Google Chrome</strong>: I haven&#x27;t quite understand what you&#x27;re providing, what&#x27;s in this notifications, like what exactly am I getting?</p>
                <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: I&#x27;ve got an email from our conversation right now. I&#x27;m going to, I&#x27;m going to stop recording</p>
